* About
This Web application lets users search for courses in Coursera and OpenUniversity by course name or 
instructor name using
the Coursera API and the OpenUniversity SPARQL endpoint. It presents the results in a table,
or as graph models on top of the designed ontology in RDF-XML or TTL formats.  The ontology 
consists of properties which are common in both OpenUniversity and Coursera.
The application uses Apache Jena for querying the 
SPARQL endpoint and manipulating graph models.
