                This Web application lets users search for courses in Coursera and OpenUniversity by course name or 
                instructor name using
                the Coursera API and the OpenUniversity SPARQL endpoint. It presents the results in a table,
                or as graph models on top of the designed ontology in RDF-XML or TTL formats.  The ontology 
                consists of properties which are common in both OpenUniversity and Coursera.
                The application uses Apache Jena for querying the 
                SPARQL endpoint and manipulating graph models.
